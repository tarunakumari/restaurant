			<h1>Our Story</h1>

			<p>In January of 1993, the 1369 Coffee House opened at 400 Riveroak Parkway.The site was the former home of the 1369 Jazz Club, a well known local bar and music venue. In June 1994 we opened a second store in nearby Central Square. </p> 
     <p>Many people think communities are formed through shared experience.  Whether it’s a community of writers, artists or an ethnic community – they are bound by commonalities.</p>
            
            <p>Neighborhood communities are formed through shared spaces – places where people gather, meet friends, and recognize friendly faces.1369 strives to be the coffeehouse you call home.We want to be your third place – away from work and home – that you feel comfortable enough to read, hang out in, meet friends, or get some work done.</p>

			<p>From the beginning, we envisioned 1369 as more than just a place to get coffee. We offer the very best coffees and teas available. We strive to create a comfortable, inviting atmosphere and to be an integral part of the community. Many friendships, including several marriages, have developed at 1369. Several books and many theses have been written at our tables. We take pride in being a good neighbor and local gathering place. We are dedicated to maintaining this feeling.</p>

			<p>We have been fortunate to be the recipient of many awards and accolades. We continue to pursue our goals in an effort to achieve excellence in all we do. We intend to survive the onslaught of chains and to endure long into the future. We will continue our commitment to our neighborhood and community.</p>
